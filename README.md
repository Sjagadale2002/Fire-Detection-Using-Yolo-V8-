# Fire Detection by suyog
Author-Suyog Jagadale
Fire detection is a crucial safety feature for preventing damage and loss of life. Traditional fire detection systems often rely on smoke and temperature sensors, which may not be effective in open or large spaces. This project leverages the power of the YOLOv8 object detection model to detect fire visually in real time from video feeds.

### Features

- **Real-time detection:** Uses live video streams to detect fire.
- **High accuracy:** YOLOv8 provides excellent accuracy in detection with real-time processing.
- **Wide area coverage:** Capable of detecting fire over large areas using camera feeds.
- **Early detection:** Potentially identifies fire sooner than traditional methods.

- ## Getting Started
